Although ROC graphs are apparently simple, there are some common misconceptions and pitfalls when using them in practice. The purpose of this article is to serve as an introduction to ROC graphs and as a guide for using them in research."

abstract="Modern high-energy astroparticle experiments produce large amounts of data everyday in continuous high-volume streams. The First G-APD Cherenkov Telescope (FACT) aims at detecting particle showers of gamma rays, because cosmic events can be derived from the energy and angle of gamma rays. The separation of gamma rays from background noise, which is inevitably recorded, is called the Gamma-Hadron separation problem. Current solutions heavily rely on hand-crafted features. The current approach computes these features in a long data processing pipeline and trains a random forest classifier for the Gamma-Hadron separation. The overall machine learning pipeline is executed on commodity computer hardware after an event has occurred. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach which applies (Binary) Convolutional Neural Networks (B-CNN) directly to the raw feature stream of the telescope's camera. We investigate if these models can be executed on commodity hardware available at the telescope to handle its datastream in real time. For fully Binary Neural Networks we also study the use of FPGAs for inference. Our experiments show that this approach outperforms hand-crafted features and random forests by a large margin, while still being applicable in real-time for moderate sized models. Furthermore, we show that our approach does not only work well on simulated data, but also on real cosmic events originating in the Crab Nebula, a supernova remnant.",

In this sense, multilayer feedforward networks are a class of universal approximators.}

publisher = {JMLR.org},
abstract = {Many computer vision algorithms depend on configuration settings that are typically hand-tuned in the course of evaluating the algorithm for a particular data set. While such parameter tuning is often presented as being incidental to the algorithm, correctly setting these parameter choices is frequently critical to realizing a method's full potential. Compounding matters, these parameters often must be re-tuned when the algorithm is applied to a new problem domain, and the tuning process itself often depends on personal experience and intuition in ways that are hard to quantify or describe. Since the performance of a given technique depends on both the fundamental quality of the algorithm and the details of its tuning, it is sometimes difficult to know whether a given technique is genuinely better, or simply better tuned.In this work, we propose a meta-modeling approach to support automated hyperparameter optimization, with the goal of providing practical tools that replace hand-tuning with a reproducible and unbiased optimization process. Our approach is to expose the underlying expression graph of how a performance metric (e.g. classification accuracy on validation examples) is computed from hyperparameters that govern not only how individual processing steps are applied, but even which processing steps are included. A hyperparameter optimization algorithm transforms this graph into a program for optimizing that performance metric. Our approach yields state of the art results on three disparate computer vision problems: a face-matching verification task (LFW), a face identification task (PubFig83) and an object recognition task (CIFAR-10), using a single broad class of feed-forward vision architectures.},

In addition, a model is presented for predicting the moonlight as a function of the moon's phase, the zenith distance of the moon, the zenith distance of the sky position, the angular separation of the moon and sky position, and the local extinction coefficient. The model equations can be quickly calculated on a pocket calculator. A comparison of the model with lunar data and with some Russian solar data shows the accuracy of the predictions to range from 8 percent to 23 percent.}
