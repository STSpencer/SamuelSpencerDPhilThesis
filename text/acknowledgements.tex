\subsection*{Personal}

This is where you thank your advisor, colleagues, and family and friends.

Figures are my own, unless expressly stated otherwise. 

T. Armstrong performed simulations needed for the results in Chapter \ref{ch:3-TimingInfo}, though the analysis of those simulations was performed by myself. R. Prado played a similar role for the simulations used in \ref{ch:4-VERITASRealData}, and G. Maier made the changes needed to \textit{eventdisplay} that made the deep learning analysis possible, although I was responsible for the creation of the rest of the analysis pipeline.


\subsection*{Institutional}

Chapter 3: This work used the European Grid Infrastructure. We thank Luisa Arrabito and Johan Bregeon for their assistance in running our simulations and code on it. Later training runs in this paper used the \textit{Glamdring} cluster in Oxford; we thank Jonathan Patterson for his work in upgrading and maintaining this facility. SS acknowledges an STFC Ph.D. studentship. GC, JW and TA acknowledge support from STFC grants ST/S002618/1 and ST/M00757X/1. GC acknowledges support from Exeter College, Oxford. This work has gone through internal review by the CTA Consortium, who we thank for allowing us to use CTA simulation models. We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the agencies and organisations listed here: \url{http://www.cta-observatory.org/consortium\_acknowledgments}.
