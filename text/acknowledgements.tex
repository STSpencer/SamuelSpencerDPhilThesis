\textbf{All Chapters}: Samuel Spencer acknowledges an STFC Ph.D. studentship, as well as additional support from Oxford University Department of Physics following the Covid-19 pandemic. We also thank the developers of \textit{ctapipe} for providing an invaluable new tool for $\gamma$-ray data analysis. \newline
\textbf{Chapter 3}: This work used the European Grid Infrastructure. We thank Luisa Arrabito and Johan Bregeon for their assistance in running our simulations and code on it. Garret Cotter, Jason Watson and Thomas Armstrong acknowledge support from STFC grants ST/S002618/1 and ST/M00757X/1. Garret Cotter acknowledges support from Exeter College, Oxford. This work has gone through internal review by the CTA Consortium, who we thank for allowing us to use CTA simulation models. We gratefully acknowledge financial support from the agencies and organisations listed here: \url{http://www.cta-observatory.org/consortium\_acknowledgments}. \newline
\textbf{Chapters 3 and 4}: This work used the \textit{Glamdring} cluster in Oxford; we thank Jonathan Patterson for his work in upgrading and maintaining this facility, as well as setting up the MongoDB database used for the parallelised optimisation in Chapter \ref{ch:4-VERITASRealData}. \newline
\textbf{Chapter 4}; We thank the VERITAS Consortium for allowing us to use VERITAS simulation models and data. We thank the computing support group at DESY for providing cluster resources. \newline
\textbf{Chapter 5}: We thank Matthias Buchele and colleagues in H.E.S.S. for the original development work on the \textit{nsb} tool. This work has made use of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) mission \href{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/gaia}{\textit{Gaia}}, processed by the \textit{Gaia} Data Processing and Analysis Consortium (\href{https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/gaia/dpac/consortium}{DPAC}). Funding for the DPAC has been provided by national institutions, in particular the institutions participating in the \textit{Gaia} Multilateral Agreement.
