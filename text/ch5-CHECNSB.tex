\section{Introduction}
NSB is part of the reason deep learning methods of analysis don't currently work. Being able to better model NSB is a key component of CTA analysis that no-one else is doing. If you want to operate your camera under moonlit conditions you've got to understand the intensity distributions you're likely to encounter. Moonlit observations likely to be critical to CTA transient science as it increases your possible observing time by around 30 percent.
