T. Armstrong performed simulations needed for the results in Chapter \ref{ch:3-TimingInfo}, though the analysis of those simulations was performed by myself. R. Prado played a similar role for the simulations used in \ref{ch:4-VERITASRealData}, and G. Maier made the changes needed to \textit{Eventdisplay} to make it compatible with the deep learning analysis, although I was responsible for the creation of the rest of the analysis pipeline.
